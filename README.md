## 🫐🐒: “Mulberry monkey” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16).

codename(seed = "ta ongo china", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "mulberry monkey"
```
