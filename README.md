## Abstract

The regulatory environment for international nongovernmental
organizations (INGOs) has become increasingly restricted. The level of
restriction INGOs face in practice varies, however. INGOs working on
non-contentious issues such as humanitarian aid tend to see less
restriction than those working on more contentious issues like advocacy.
In spite of these restrictions, contentious organizations are often able
to continue their work by relying on their operational flexibility. In
this paper we explore the sources of this operational flexibility to
determine which organizational factors allow INGOs to work effectively
under legal restrictions. China provides an excellent setting for
testing our argument. Its 2017 Overseas NGO (ONGO) law created two
avenues for operating in the country: hundreds of INGOs have obtained
permanent formal registration and while thousands work through temporary
activities lasting no more than one year. Using data on both (1) formal
and temporary activities registration and (2) organization-level
characteristics such as issue areas, funding sources, and other
instrumental details, we examine what determines if an INGO registers
formally or through temporary activities. Our results provide an
empirical illustration of the practical effect of NGO restrictions on
global civil society and how organizations can adapt to this new legal
environment.

## 🫐🐒: “Mulberry monkey” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16).

codename(seed = "ta ongo china", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "mulberry monkey"
```
